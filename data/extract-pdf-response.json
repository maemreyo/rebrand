Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy\ntext ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley\nof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has\nsurvived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic\ntypesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in\nthe 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem\nIpsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing\nsoftware like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the\nreadable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of\nusing Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution\nof letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',\nmaking it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing\npackages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their\ndefault model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover\nmany web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved\nover the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose\n(injected humour and the like).\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.\nIt has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,\nmaking it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin\nprofessor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of\nthe more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum\npassage, and going through the cites of the word in classical\nliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum\ncomes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum\net Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in\n45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular\nduring the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem\nipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is\nreproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and\n1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also\nreproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English\nversions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,\nbut the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected\nhumour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly\nbelievable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you\nneed to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the\nmiddle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet\ntend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the\nfirst true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200\nLatin words, combined with a handful of model sentence\nstructures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The\ngenerated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,\ninjected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\n5\nparagraphs\nwords\nbytes\nlists\nStart with 'Lorem\nipsum dolor sit amet...'\nGenerate Lorem Ipsum\nDonate: If you use this site regularly and would like to help keep the site on the Internet, please consider donating a small sum to help pay\nfor the hosting and bandwidth bill.

Rackham\n\"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete\naccount of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No\none rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure\nrationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of\nitself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To\ntake a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any\nright to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that\nproduces no resultant pleasure?\"\nSection 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC\n\"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores\net quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est\nlaborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi\noptio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus.\nTemporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae\nnon recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut\nperferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.\"\n1914 translation by H. Rackham\n\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of\npleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame\nbelongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These\ncases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents\nour being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing\nto the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.\nThe wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,\nor else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"\n7/7/25, 3:51 PMLorem Ipsum - All the facts - Lipsum generator\nhttps://www.lipsum.com2/2",
