# DocRebrander Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the DocRebrander application to process your documents.

## 1. Getting Started

To use DocRebrander, ensure you have access to the application interface. This is typically a web-based application.

## 2. Processing a Document

1.  **Paste Raw Text:** In the main application interface, you will find a text area. Paste the raw text content of your document into this area.

2.  **Process Text:** Click the "Process Text" button. The application will then use AI to analyze your text and convert it into a structured, editable format.

3.  **Edit Your Document:** Once processing is complete, the structured content will appear in a rich text editor (Tiptap). You can now edit, format, and refine your document using the provided toolbar options (e.g., bold, italic, headings, lists, tables).
